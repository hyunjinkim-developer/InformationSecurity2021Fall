Write a programming code that can encrypt and decrypt using S-AES (Simplified AES) 
Test data: A binary plaintext of 0110 1111 0110 1011 encrypted with a binary key of 1010 0111 0011 1011 should give a binary ciphertext of 0000 0111 0011 1000. 
Decryption should work correspondingly. 
Provide the code and the execution proof.
